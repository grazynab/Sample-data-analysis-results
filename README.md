## Sample data analysis results
In this repository I present some of data analysis I did by myself on my own data, using what I learned during statistics courses on the University, outside of the University and studying books and online courses. It contains:
- two scientifical posters I presented on 32nd European Mustelid Colloquium, showing some visuals and simplest conclusions possible
- my sum-up presentation of analyses I have done on Multivariate Analysis of Ecological Data - Advanced course, which shows in a nutshell some serious data mining I had to do to unveil any patterns in the data I had for that time
